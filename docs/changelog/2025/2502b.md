As a result of a minor oversight, an incorrect waypoint was loaded on NZWB RNP 24 and a secondary RNP 24 approach with an IAF of the discontinued `JAMIE` waypoint was incorrectly part of the dataset. This rush revision fixes these errors.

## Fixes
- NZWB RNP 24 modified to change incorrect `ELKUB` waypoint to `WB724`
- NZWB RNP 24 approach with `JAMIE` IAF removed. RNP 24 approach with `LUTKA` IAF remains.
