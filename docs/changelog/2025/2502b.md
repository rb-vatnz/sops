As a result of a minor dataset production error, an incorrect waypoint was loaded on NZWB RNP 24. additionally, an incorrect designator for a transition on this approach was missed when reviewing the procedure. This rush revision fixes these errors.

## Fixes
- NZWB RNP 24 Waypoint `ELKUB` replaced by `WB724`
- NZWB RNP 24 approach with IAF `JAMIE` removed. RNP 24 approach with IAF `LUTKA` remains
